About
-----

SALOR Hospitality (also known as Bill Gastro) is a professional and universal Point of Sale software for hotels, restaurants, bars and shops.

If you install SALOR Hospitality on a computer (e.g. a mini PC), and connect receipt printers, touch screens and a WiFi Bridge, you will end up with much more than a regular Point of Sale system. Depending on your needs, you can build **your own management system for your hospitality business** which you can access conveniently from any computer or mobile device (e.g. smartphone or tablet) which is connected to your internal network.

Because you can extend the installation to your heart's content, SALOR Hospitality helps you to **improve the communication between staff in your business**, and you will be able to serve your customers much quicker.

SALOR Hospitality sends tickets into your kitchen or bar and makes printing of professional business invoices and accounting reports very easy. This simplifies your accounting work to an extreme degree and you can **dedicate more time for more important things**: the personal contact with your customers.

You also can generate statistics to see during which business hours your store is most profitable and plan the work hours of your staff according to it.

SALOR Hospitality has many more useful features that are described in more detail in the [Feature Catalog](http://billgastro.com/features/).

Philosophy of technology
------------------------

The applications consists of a lean Ruby-on-Rails backend (Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.2.6) with a MySQL database which is responsible for delivering and storing of data, controlling all attached printers, whereas the the actual Point of Sale interface is entirely controlled by offline Javascript and an offline database. This concept unites the advantages of networking between many handhelds in one store (or many stores of a restaurant/hotel chain) with an amazing responsiveness of the user interface (UI). Because all Javascript and data are residing in the RAM of the browser, a steady connection to the server is not even required. The Javascript application communicates its data via small JSON objects, which only a few dozen bytes per taking an order. If the server cannot be reached, the data are stored in a queue and can be re-sent once the connection is established again.

Because SALOR Hospitality is based on standard web technologies, it can immediately be used with a wide variety of standard hardware or Operating Systems without hassle: Windows, Linux, OS X, PC's, MAC's, desktops, laptops, handhelds, tablets and smartphones. Just fire up your browser and enter the the URL of your SALOR server. SALOR can distinguish between large and small screens and delivers styles accordingly.

Maturity
--------

Many hospitality enterprises -- usually high-stress and high-pressure environments -- already enjoy the use of SALOR Hospitality. They have contributed feedback to make SALOR the excellent product it is today.

Multi-Store, Multi-Company
--------------------------

SALOR Hospitality has true multi-store (and even multi-company) support built in. That way, you deploy once, and serve many of your stores at once.


Try the Demo!
------------

You can try SALOR Hospitality immediately. Install Google Chrome, Chromium or Safari (or any browser based on Webkit), browse to [demo1.sh.red-e.eu](http://demo1.sh.red-e.eu) and log in with the default password 001 (zero-zero-one).

Support for Mozilla Firefox is limited to the Restaurant part. The Hotel part makes use of a browser-internal SQL database, which is not supported in Firefox. We never really tested Microsoft Internet Explorer, so you are on your own if you want to use this browser.


Installation
------------

You need a few packages so that native extensions of ruby gems will compile successfully:

    apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev imagemagick libmagick-dev libmagickwand-dev

Depending on your Linux Distribution, you also must install the Ruby interpreter of the version family 1.9 (we work with ruby-1.9.3.194), either via `apt-get install ruby1.9.1` or a Ruby Version Manager like `rvm`.

Any Rails developer will not have any problems running SalorHospitality, since it is just a plain Rails project without any special magic going on:

    git clone git://github.com/michaelfranzl/SalorHospitality.git
    cd SalorHospitality/salor-hospitality
    cp Gemfile.production Gemfile
    {{ or use Gemfile.development if appropriate }}
    cd config
    cp database.yml.template database.yml
    cd ..
    bundle install
    {{ edit config/database.yml for your MySQL installation }}
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed
    rails s
    {{ browse to localhost:3000 and enter 000 as password }}

If you want to re-seed the database do the following:

    rake db:drop
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed
